# GNU-Radio-FM-Radio-Audio
GNU radio companion program that demodulates audio of FM radio station and displays a filtered FFT


This is different then the last one, which just shows the FFT plot of RF in the environment. This GRC actually demodulates and streams audio to the sound card to listen to the FM radio station

FFT plot also looks a bit cleaner due to the low pass filter
